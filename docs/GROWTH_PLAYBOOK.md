3. Distribution

- Post before/after demo clips and CLI output
- Publish short technical writeups with code snippets

4. Retention
- Triage issues quickly
- Tag beginner-friendly tasks
- Keep changelog and release notes high quality

## Weekly Execution Loop

1. Ship at least one user-visible improvement
2. Publish one release note with concrete examples
3. Run QA and confirm install/uninstall on macOS + Ubuntu
4. Review open issues/PRs and close stale items
5. Track star delta and top traffic sources
